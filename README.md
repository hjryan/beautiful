# beautiful

beautiful is a Slack app written using Bolt for Python. It includes:
- automated updates of an emoji tracking channel via the Slack API
- an analysis of whether it's hotter where I am or where Bianca is using calls to the OpenWeather API
- a list of nearby hot dog retailers using calls to the Yelp API
- a variety of annoying emoji-based Easter eggs

Here are those features in action:
